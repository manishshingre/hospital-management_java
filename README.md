# Hospital Management System

Our Project “The hospital Management System” includes different components such as registration of patients, storing all the details of the doctors, staff, nurses, medical facilities provided by the hospital and also about the pathology lab and pharmacy. This project is mainly to help the admin staff of the hospital to manage all the records on software instead of playing with different files to keep the record. 
 
In this project, details can be entered using various aspects such as id, name, gender, etc. As the records kept in a hospital management system remain with the hospital even after the patient is discharged or any staff member resigns. So, you can only add data into the system and not delete it. This project is a “MENU-DRIVEN” project and the interface is very friendly to use.
 
The main purpose of a hospital management system is to deliver convenience and reduce the time of work which uplifts the productivity of the staff working.

## TECHNICAL IDEA

In this project, we tried to make a combination of command-line input as well as a few aspects of GUI. The main menu to show all the facilities available in the hospital, selecting the options, displaying the previous as well as new data and showing all the list of doctors, patients, nurses, etc. is done through the command line. Jswing dialogue boxes are used for taking the inputs from the user. It takes input for various fields like name, id, room no., gender, etc. While taking inputs from the user we have made sure at a few places that the user enters appropriate information. We have used the try-catch block method to catch errors and display customized errors. We have also implemented the drop-down menu for selecting gender. So that the user won’t get confused about what to enter.  

Overall the code we have implemented different classes and methods for each section to execute. The methods are called in loops to execute a particular function and carry on the program accordingly.
